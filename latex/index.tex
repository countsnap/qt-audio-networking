The program is a simple Vo\+I\+P application that is cross-\/platform and allows users to “conference call” across a local network. Transmission is near instant (dependant on network performance), and there is no noticeable lag or latency when communicating. It allows participants to select whether they wish to broadcast or listen (or both). Audio is compressed using zlib, and is sent at C\+D quality (44.\+1khz, 16 channels), and does not utilise any audio codecs.
